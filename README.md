# 🚀 Headless CMS Portfolio (React + Vite + Sanity)

This project is my **transition from hardcoded websites into the headless CMS ecosystem**.  
It demonstrates how content can be managed dynamically in **Sanity CMS** while being rendered through a fast, modern **React + Vite frontend**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Showcase my ability to **integrate a headless CMS** into a modern frontend stack.  
- Move away from static, hardcoded sites toward **scalable, editable, and dynamic content systems**.  
- Highlight creative storytelling sections (sticky scroll, hobbies stack, impact metrics, FAQs) that are **CMS‑driven but resilient with fallbacks**.  
- Position myself for opportunities in **modern web development, JAMstack, and content‑driven applications**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Sanity CMS Integration**: All content (FAQs, hobbies, impact metrics) editable in Sanity Studio.  
- **Fallback Content**: Local assets (`knowme.png`, `Toonme.png`, `HeroMobile.png`, `HeroImg.png`) ensure reliability if CMS data is missing.  
- **Sticky Split Scroll**: Text and visuals synced in a cinematic storytelling layout.  
- **Hobbies Stack**: Interactive card stack with hover animations, images editable via CMS.  
- **Impact Metrics**: Auto‑counting stats (subscribers, reach, projects).  
- **FAQ Accordion**: CMS‑driven questions with a hardcoded Contact FAQ linking to the contact page.  
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth transitions and interactivity.  
- **TailwindCSS Styling**: Responsive and modern UI.
